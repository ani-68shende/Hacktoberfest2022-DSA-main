/*
There is a one-dimensional garden of starting at 0 and ending at n, with n + 1 fountains. In each position of the N length garden, a fountain has been installed. 
Given an array a[]such that a[i] describes the coverage limit of ith fountain. 
A fountain can cover the range from the position max(i â€“ a[i], 1) to min(i + a[i], N). 
In beginning, all the fountains are switched off. 
The task is to find the minimum number of fountains needed to be activated such that the whole N-length garden can be covered by water.
