Algorithm:
1.main calculation is to find those which are squares of prime numbers 
and less than or equal to the number.
2.Start a loop for integer i from 2 to n.
3. Check if i is prime or not using the isPrime(n) function.
4. If i is prime, check if its square is less than or equal to the given number. 
This will be checked only for squares of prime numbers, therefore reducing the number of checks.
5.If the above condition is satisfied, the number will be printed and the loop will continue till i<=n.
