# Wordle Solver

This is a python mini project that can be used to solve the famous puzzle game [WORDLE](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

The `sort_words.py` script has been used to sort a list of all 5-letter words based on the frequency of each alphabet in english language.

The `wordle_agent.py` script generates valid guesses of 5-letter words from this sorted list of words.

To solve any WORDLE, run `wordle_agent.py` and for each guess enter WORDLE's response in the terminal.
