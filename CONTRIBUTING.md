## Why is program documentation important?
-> The main purpose of program documentation is to describe the design of your program. <br>
-> The documentation also provides the framework in which to place the code. <br>
-> as coding progresses, the code is inserted into the framework already created by the program documentation.<br>
-> Documentation is important to tell other programmers what the program does and how it works. <br>
-> In the "real world" and in some classes here at BGSU, programmers often work in teams to develop code. <br>
-> Documentation helps others on the team to understand your work.<br>
-> Maintenance and debugging are needed sooner or later for most programs and these are frequently done by someone other than the original programmer. <br>
-> Documentation can help the programmer who is making the modifications understand your code.<br>
-> Documenting your program during development helps you to maintain your sanity.<br><br>

## When should program documentation be done?

-> When designing your program, you must spend time thinking about how to structure your program, what modules are needed, and the algorithms and processes you will use in the modules. <br>
-> You must think about what sort of data structures and objects (e.g., arrays, files or linked lists) are needed. <br>
-> This thinking must be done before you start coding, or you will find yourself wasting time writing useless code that is full of errors. <br>
-> It is very important to record this creative process so that the programmers that follow you do not duplicate work that you have already done.<br>
<br>
-> Before writing the code, you should write the documentation to describe the design of each component of your program. <br>
-> Writing documentation for the modules before writing the code helps you define exactly what each module should do and how it will interact with other modules. <br>
-> Focusing on the design and the steps needed to solve the problem can help prevent errors in the completed program.<br><br><br>

## What information should be in the program documentation?
For an individual module, it is important to record <br>
(1) who has written the module, <br>
(2) when the module was written or modified, <br>
(3) why the module was written or modified, <br>
(4) how the module interacts with other modules, <br>
(5) what special algorithms were used, if any, and <br>
(6) acknowledge outside sources for ideas and algorithms. <br>

## For data structures, it is important to record 
(1) what data structure is used, <br>
(2) why a particular structure was used, <br>
(3) what data is contained in the structure, and <br>
(4) how the data structure is implemented.<br>
