/* Question : Team RCB has earned X points in the games it has played so far in this year's IPL. To qualify for the playoffs they must earn at least a total of Y points. They currently have Z games left, in each game they earn 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and no points for a loss. 
Is it possible for RCB to qualify for the playoffs this year?
